      <p className="mb-4">
        Gender-Based Violence (GBV) has existed in societies for centuries, yet it has often been hidden in plain sight. 
        Women, men, and non-binary individuals have suffered humiliation, abuse, beatings, and even rape—sometimes without 
        knowing that what they experienced was a violation of their rights.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Historically, many survivors lacked awareness of their legal rights or social support systems. Cases of domestic 
        violence, sexual assault, and other forms of abuse often went unreported due to fear, shame, or lack of knowledge 
        about <strong>where to turn</strong> for help. Cultural norms and societal expectations frequently silenced victims, 
        leaving them isolated and stigmatized.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Even when survivors wanted to report incidents, the path was confusing. They might not have known:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><strong>How</strong> to report the abuse (police, authorities, or social organizations).</li>
        <li><strong>Where</strong> to find support (shelters, counseling, or legal aid).</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong> it was safe to speak up, often fearing retaliation or community judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong> their voices mattered, as some were led to believe their suffering was “normal” or deserved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This gap—between those who suffer and those who can help—has left generations vulnerable. Cases of rape, physical 
        assault, emotional abuse, and coercion were often hidden, perpetuating cycles of fear and silence.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Recognizing this persistent challenge sparked an idea: <strong>what if there were a tool to empower survivors and 
        communities with knowledge, access, and immediate support?</strong> That’s why this app was created.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This platform is designed to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Educate users on GBV, its forms, and their rights.</li>
        <li>Provide guidance on how to report incidents safely and confidentially.</li>
        <li>Connect survivors to legal, medical, and psychological support.</li>
        <li>Create a safe space to share experiences and access resources without shame or fear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Through this app, what was once hidden or misunderstood becomes visible, actionable, and addressed. 
        By leveraging technology, we create <strong>an opportunity for prevention, empowerment, and justice</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This journey—from understanding the silent suffering of the past to building a tool for today—reflects a 
        commitment to break cycles of abuse. Every survivor deserves to be heard, supported, and protected, 
        and this app is a step toward making that a reality.
